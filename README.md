# Computer Infrastructure Tasks and Project

## Overview
This repository contains the tasks and project associated with the Computer Infrastructure module. The tasks are specifically selected to become more familar with using the command line to move and manipulate data and write scripts. With this knowledge, the user should be able to carry out the project which is to automate a bash script to run daily and push new data into a repository regularly.

## Tasks 1-7
Tasks 1-7 are summarised in the weather.ipynb folder.

## Task 8: Weather.ipynb
This task summarises and explains the commands used to carry out tasks 1-7, from creating the necessary folders using the `mkdir` command all the way to creating a bash script that saves a weather data file from the Met Eireann website in the data2/timestamps/weather folder and saves it as the date and time that the file is saved. 

## Task 9: Weather.ipynb
This folder also contains task 9 which has the data frame of the weather data and an explanation of what the data contains.
